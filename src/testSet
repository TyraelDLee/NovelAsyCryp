COMP4450 Assignment 4

Question 1 (10 marks): Please describe your research question. What is it,
you are trying to do? Please give enough details so that any of the tutors can
understand it. (Max 250 words)
Asymmetric cryptography background: Asymmetric cryptography consists by
a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption). The main idea
of such cryptographic algorithm is based on mathematical problems to
generate one-way functions. In such algorithm, everyone knows the receiver’s
public key can use to encrypt a message and send to receiver; and the
message can only be decrypted by receiver’s private key.
Digital Certificate Background: Digital signature is a message digest algorithm
with a key. This key includes a public key and a private key. It is used to verify
data integrity, authenticate data sources, and resist denial. It follows the OSI
reference model, private key signature, and public key verification. The
common digital signature algorithms are mainly RSA, DSA, ECDSA.
Our research problem is about finding a new kind of asymmetric cryptography
algorithm to reduce the amount of calculation in the process of encryption,
decryption and digital signature, make the calculation faster and information
transmission more secure. The main idea of this algorithm comes from RSA,
which based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large
prime number. With larger prime numbers, the complexity of the algorithm
increases exponentially. This kind of property is similar to one-way function,
which is easy to compute on every input, but extremely hard to get solution
reversely. We called this novel asymmetric algorithm is HCA (half cut algorithm).
Question 2 (10 marks): Please motivate your research question: Why did
you think this question is interesting and important? (max 500 words)
In the present, the current mainstream of computer science is about AI, data
mining and so on. But we believe that encryption algorithms are the most
important part of network security but also the most easily neglected part. For
netizens, they lack the corresponding security awareness, ‘encryption
algorithms’, ‘RSA’, ‘MD5’ these professional words are difficult for them to
understand. For professional technicians, when they found the current
encryption algorithm they used exist vulnerabilities. The first thing they will do
is to calculate the cost of upgrading the safer encryption algorithm and the
incomes that the upgrade can bring. However, if the cost of upgrading is much
more that income, even if users’ private has potential risks of leakage,
technicians will remain the same encryption algorithm. (Ref: CISSP) We think
the rapid development of AI, data mining just like a person owns a huge
amount of property in house but did not do any protective measures.
Therefore, in a very short period, the demand for professional technicians in
the security field will increase rapidly. This research project is a practice and
prepare for security field. That’s the reason for why we choose topic about
encryption algorithm.
With the rapid development of technology, the emergence of supercomputers
and the increasing performance of personal computers, algorithms that used
to require brute-force computer cracking for more than 50 years may now only
take a few hours or even a few minutes. The algorithm proposed as early as
20 years ago is not enough to meet the current security requirements of
encryption algorithms.
In technical perspective: Many encryption algorithms like MD4, MD5, SHA1
considered harmful today. In 2005, Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu had
successfully break MD5 (Wang & Yun, 2005). And MD5 has already been
cracked within 5 hours using a PC with Pentium 4 1.70GHz CPU (Jie Liang,
2007). Through MD5 hash collision can generate a fake digital certificate that
is the same as the real digital certificate. Therefore, hackers use this method
to generate phishing websites to steal users’ information. In 1994 Peter Shor
proved that Quantum computer can factorization done in polynomial time.
With the development of Quantum computer technology, RSA will gradually
become insecure.
For personal reason: Lack of security will directly make users’ personal
information loss, for example: bank account, private medical record, address
and so on.
For business: Security issues for a company means that the company’s

reputation, credibility, and pecuniary will suffer significant loss.
Question 3 (20 marks): What is the current state of the art regarding your
research question. Please give an overall summary (max 750 words, 10
